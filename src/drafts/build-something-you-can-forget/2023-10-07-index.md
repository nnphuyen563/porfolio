<p class="lead">I built a small website in 2015. Nothing fancy, just a WordPress thing with a custom theme. My client was happy, and we went our separate ways.</p>

A few weeks ago, that client asked me for a tiny change. Basically just 2 lines of CSS that needed adjusting. Still, when I read their email, my heart sank.

"Oh shit", I thought, "I haven't touched that codebase in forever". It uses Grunt tasks, an ancient node version and a couple of third-party plugins from back when everyone was listening to "Call Me Maybe". This will not go well.
