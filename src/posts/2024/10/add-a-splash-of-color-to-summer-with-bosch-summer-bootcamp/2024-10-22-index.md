### Introduction

My 3 months participating in the Bosch Summer Bootcamp 2024 and interning at Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam will be shared in this post. These were days of experiencing a dream work environment, working alongside associates who supported me during my trip to India, and realizing how different I am when working as an office person.

### Chapter 1: early summer days

At the end of April and the beginning of May, after completing the Data Engineer Zoomcamp, I finally felt quite confident and ready to step into the job market. At that time, I wasn't exactly all-in for Bosch; I simply sent my CV wherever felt right, with a relaxed mindset, not too impatient. Coincidentally, Bosch began promoting the Bosch Summer Bootcamp 2024 program during that period. After reading the job description, which seemed like a great fit, I applied right away.

I really love Bosch, especially BGSV, because, since the previous summer, I’ve had the opportunity to work with and experience the company through programs like One Day Boschler 2023, SPARK OFF, the Activator Scholarship, and a talent exchange trip to India. I genuinely wanted to work at BGSV, so when I submitted my CV, I actively “sent a message to the universe,” and fortunately, everything went smoothly.

My interview process, in a nutshell, was “interview in the morning, offer in the afternoon.” I was the first person to interview for the Data Engineer Intern position (which I applied for, and it focuses on low-code solutions). This position was only open for one person, and I’m fortunate to have the opportunity to take it. Send a heartfelt message and one day, you’ll work at your dream company!

### Chapter 2: onboard day and welcome 24 campers

After a month of summer break at home, I returned to Saigon to prepare for my first day at work – Onboarding Day. It was a sunny mid-June day, and after traveling more than 20 km from the "university village" to the company, Bosch welcomed me with an incredibly warm and joyful onboarding session.

The onboarding day at Bosch gave me a very different feeling. Instead of jumping straight into work, we spent the entire day getting to know each other and learning about the company’s policies and regulations. We listened, played games, and got to meet other associates, even from different departments. We had our company ID photos taken, submitted the necessary paperwork, received guidance on company policies, learned about employee benefits, and even played team-building games together. By the end of the day, the team’s Buddy members came to welcome us (this time, our department had three new members: two interns and one associate). We met our associates, and got to see where we’d be working in the coming months.

After the onboarding day, I also attended the Opening Ceremony of the Summer Bootcamp 2024, where I met and connected with nearly 17 other talented Campers. The opening gave me a broader view of the challenging three-month internship ahead, which, as HR mentioned, would be "hardcore" compared to a typical internship program. This is because we are only interning for three months, half the time of regular interns at BGSW, while also attending soft skills training sessions and working in teams to tackle program challenges. I also had the chance to meet and interact with the HR Buddy, my Mentors, and other Campers through fun icebreaker games. Even though it’s only been two days at work, I’m already filled with excitement for the 90 days ahead.
