  tận hưởng hết mình mọi cơ hội mà vũ trụ ban cho và thực hiện những mong ước
  vừa non nớt nhưng cũng vừa tham vọng của bản thân. Và trong số những ước mơ đó
  chắc chắn là có một góc không thể thiếu của Bosch, cuối cùng hành trình trở
  thành Boschler #LikeABosch của mình cũng đã bắt đầu rồi."

### Introduction

My 3 months participating in the Bosch Summer Bootcamp 2024 and interning at Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam will be shared in this post. These were days of experiencing a dream work environment, working alongside associates who supported me during my trip to India, and realizing how different I am when working as an office person.

### Chapter 1: early summer days

At the end of April and the beginning of May, after completing the Data Engineer Zoomcamp, I finally felt quite stable and confident enough to step into the job market. Back then, I wasn’t all-in for Bosch; I just planned to send my CV wherever felt right, with a relaxed mindset and no rush. Coincidentally, around that time, Bosch started promoting their Bosch Summer Bootcamp 2024 program. After reading the job description, which seemed like a great fit, I applied right away.

I really love Bosch, especially BGSV (Bosch Global Software Technologies Vietnam), because the previous summer I had the chance to work and collaborate with the company’s associates through events like One Day Boschler 2023, SPARK OFF, Activator Scholarship, and the talent exchange trip to India. I really wanted to work at BGSV, so when I submitted my CV this time, I actively 'sent a message to the universe,' and luckily, everything went smoothly.

My interview process, in a nutshell, was: 'interview in the morning, offer in the afternoon.' I was the first to be interviewed for the Data Engineer Intern position (this is the role I applied for, which leans toward low-code). The position was for only one person, and I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity. With heartfelt intentions sent to the universe, I finally got to work at my dream company!

### Chapter 2: onboard and welcome to 24 campers

After a month of summer vacation at home, I returned to Saigon to prepare for my first day at work - Onboarding Day. It was a sunny day in mid-June, from the university village, I traveled more than 20 km to the company and Bosch welcomed me with an extremely warm and happy onboarding session.

Onboarding day at Bosch gave me a very different feeling, not rushing into work but spending a whole day for colleagues to get familiar with and understand the company's regulations. We got to listen, play and get to know other associates even though we were not in the same department. We took company ID photos, submitted necessary documents, were instructed on the regulations, learned about the privileges of colleagues and were also divided into groups to play games together. At the end of the day, the Buddy team members of my department also welcomed us (this time my department had 3 new members, 2 interns and 1 associate) to greet the other seniors, meet associates and know where we would be working in the future.

After the onboarding day, I also got to participate in the private Opening Ceremony of the Summer Bootcamp 2024 program and met and connected directly with nearly 17 other talented Campers. The opening ceremony helped me have a more comprehensive view of the upcoming 3-month internship full of challenges, which as the HR said would be "hardcore" compared to a normal internship program. Because we only intern for 3 months, half the time of a normal intern at BGSW, but at the same time we also have to participate in soft skills training courses and work in groups to solve the challenges that the program poses. In addition, I also got to meet and interact with my HR Buddy, my mentor, and other friends through small interactive games. After only two days of work, I am already full of anticipation for the next 90 days.

### Chapter 3: 8 days as an early bird and mastering soft skills

Going to work, not only work, but also learn. During the 12 weeks of internship at Bosch, I not only completed the assigned tasks and learned about working, applying knowledge from university into practice, but was also taught about critical thinking, turning ideas into reality and even about pitching. This is both the difference and the privilege of interns in the Summer Bootcamp program.

To minimize mistakes, learn effectively, and determine the right path, the first thing is to understand yourself, which is also the reason why Leading Self is the first topic I was taught (first 2 sessions) in the soft skills training series. The 3 main topics of this topic are Self-Awareness, Self-Management, and Self-Development.

> *To know oneself is true progress.*

Self-awareness, and self-reflection to understand aspects including inner values, beliefs, emotions and ego of life, thereby determining who you are and who you want to become. The training taught me how to understand myself better, not be afraid when I haven't found the right answer and learn to persevere step by step to create a great whole. Everyone has times when they feel overloaded, tired and that is a signal for themselves to rest. Self-management, organizing and managing yourself clearly and with a plan will help us regulate our lives more reasonably. Working hard is good, but at the same time our bodies also need to rest and relax. Learning about self-management at Bosch, I understand that stress is inevitable but understanding it and facing it is something that I can decide. From there, it helps me have more inner strength to learn more, develop more and "grow up" more. At Bosch, self-development is associated with a growth mindset, always ready to face challenges, see difficulties as opportunities to learn, and persevere in the face of challenges. As a Boschler, I not only step out of my comfort zone but also overcome my fears, be willing to learn and help myself become better every day. 

> *Be yourself but better.*

![Step out your comfort zone](summer-bootcamp.png "Bước ra khỏi vùng an toàn")

After the Leading Self topic is a training series on Critical Thinking in Communication, learning everything about critical thinking and ways to express ideas and communicate effectively with people. I went through almost all the lessons on generating ideas, expressing ideas, presenting, and debating. I learned a lot of good things through these topics, but the most impressive ones are probably the 2 practice sessions with Critical Thinking by Topic (belonging to the topic Critical Thinking in Work Sailing) and Presenting a technological aspect (belonging to the topic From Words to Verbal Communication).

I have never participated in a debate before, it was just a back-and-forth discussion about an issue. I always feel that when people show their knowledge and stand up to argue to defend their own point of view but at the same time listen to enrich their knowledge, it is really cool, like when I was a kid watching Trường Teen on TV - Vietnamese TV show. Thanks to participating in Summer Bootcamp this summer, I finally had the opportunity to experience something that I have wanted to try since I was a kid. I learned how to turn my thoughts into strong arguments, with clear arguments to convince the opposing side, and at the same time, I also learned how to listen and analyze quickly on the spot when the debate took place. An important thing that the mentor always reminded us is to always respect friends with opposing opinions, because everyone has their own thoughts, debate does not mean criticizing, or arguing but presenting opinions and discussing whether the other side's perspective on an issue is right or wrong.

I also participated in many knowledge-sharing practice sessions during the 3-month bootcamp, from mentor to content, the support from the organizers was all very good, but what I appreciated the most was when I received super detailed and dedicated feedback from the organizers. As well as debate, I have never participated in a real presentation class. At school, I have presented many times in front of the group, but it was simply to report on projects and learning results, not a session to give feedback on weaknesses in my presentation. Because I understand that its purpose lies in the content I can convey, not in the way I do it. However, when participating in the Summer Bootcamp, my weaknesses were clearly pointed out by the mentors which helped me orient myself to improve. When I received feedback, I was very surprised because, from the way I expressed my ideas, spoken language, and body language to my tone of voice, they all meticulously noted it down to give me feedback in the next paragraph. This is what I really appreciate.

### Chapter 4: the journey of 'braving the hardships' comes to an end

The three-month journey of Summer Bootcamp, which is not long but not really short, has finally come to an end. I have met and gotten to know a few more friends, known many talented people and learned many new things. My summer journey with Summer Bootcamp would not be complete without the HR associates (especially Ms. V.A, Ms. H., and Ms. K.), my colleagues (Nh., B., Tr., Ph., Mr. T.), especially the NLC3 associates and Mr. Th., the super-dedicated mentor who has helped me a lot during my 3-month internship at BGSV.

After three months, luckily my relationship with Bosch continues, I continue to be a Boschler accompanying BGSV but in a different and more wonderful role. And I believe that the end of this journey is the beginning of a more brilliant journey ahead.
